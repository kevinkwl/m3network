#+TITLE: M3 Network
#+SUBTITLE: Min-Max Modular Network
This is an implementation of the Min-Max Modular Network based on Prof. Lu Bao
Liang's work *Task Decomposition Based on Class Relations: a Modular Neural
Network Architecture for Pattern Classification*. [[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/788664/][Link to Paper]]

The implemented multi-class classifier used *libsvm* as the underlying
classifier for smaller modules. The main idea is to use min-max strategies to
combine result of multiple classifiers, circumventing the problem that skewed
datasets are often met in classification tasks.

* Requirement
- libsvm 3.22
